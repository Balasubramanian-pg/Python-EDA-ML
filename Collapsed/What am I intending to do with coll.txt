What am I intending to do with collapsed stocks?

Here are a few thought processes:

1. Using python do some basic EDA - Involves all the basic statements, 
could involve data cleaning and data normalization
2. Ploting using python - I don't know how to plot using seaborn and matplotlib
3. Draw inferences- the idea is to show the relation among stock returns and their indcidence on collapse
4. Use regression to show how the collapse occured - watch a few videos to understand why the banks collapsed and find a dependent and independent variable.
