It's very handy to use .. camera is good,5
Just go for it. Super AMOLED screen is too good. Battery back is surprising good. Charges phone fast(1.5hr). Fingers print sensor works smoothly. Camera quality is also decent enough. Trust me the proccessor is not a problem if you're not gamer. It's 8gb ram is enough for daily routine uses and don't make a problem at all. I must say battery backup is surprising.,5

Phone is awesome and full of specifications. Front finger sensor is awesome and look is fabulous. Price is reasonable,5
Premium look with top quality features above all made in India,5
Price does not justify the features. No Dolby Atoms in 20K phone. Could have given Snapdragon 712 at this price. Camera colours are very Saturated. SAmoled when compared with Samsung phones is mediocre. Bought it from market. Vivo could have done lot better for the price they are asking for. Its a OK buy.,3
Processer was waste to week working slow,3
Processors very very bad... camera is good,1

"The cell phone is great
The processor could have been better
But the looks of the phone takes it away
So you won't regret after buying it
The cell phone might be a little heavy for some people but it's manageable",5
The mobile is very good in terms of money and its camera quality is excellent. It's proceser is too good.,5
Third class phone. It's total waste of money. Once you buy it Amazon won't even entertain refund or return of the product.,1
This is a better device when compared with to other devices of this price range. The finger print sensor on the screen has  much slower response when compared to the traditional ones on the rear end of a device. The device offers a smooth performance every time. Gaming has been quite good (pubg in optimum settings). Battery capacity is ok when compared with the performance it delivers. Overall agood phone for anyone who doesn't want to play GTA 5 on this phone.,5
"THIS IS A WONDERFUL  DEVICE OF VIVO. I LIKES THE SHAPE AND DESIGN OF CAMERA IT IS WONDERFUL. IT'S DISPLAY IS ALSO BEST. IT'S PROCESSOR  IS GOOD.
IT'S BATTERY IS LONG LASTING. REST OF THE THINGS ARE BETTER.",5
This is my 3rd vivo after V17pro n V17...I must say S1 pro has a unique design and load with some fabulous features...I gift this to my wife n she loved it...delivery was quick before time...,5
This phone option are too good. Compare to other phone set,5
This phone was good but battery was dead too fast among this all are good.,5
Totally liked it. Good,5
"Value for money... Best phone to buy if the budget range is in or about 20k. Great phone, brilliants specificationa, great service by amazon. The phone has a very ricch look. Modern styling and good hand feel. Weight is around 195 gms. Great battery.",5

Worst product at this price. Rear camera is not good. Processor is outdated. 10K phone have such processor. can't play PUBG smoothly. 1 star given for the design and front camera. only two card slots available. that means if you use one slot for memory card then only one sim card you can use. fell like hell..,1
"Worst product I have ever purchased,too much hanging problem which was not excepted, this phone is very slow,I don't understand how come a phone so slow when it has 8gb RAM, and the processor is alos good. Worthless product from VIVO.",1
"Worst product. Never buy. Slippery  nature, not fiiting proper in hand. Simply Amazon forcing the customer to use it instead of return or replacement. Don't buy online unless u physically see the demo or physical touch of product. Website display is more of graphics.
Worst product features.",1
