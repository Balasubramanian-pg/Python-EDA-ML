This code helps to do the following things
# Identify the individual video IDs 
Once the individual video IDs are found you can start scraping any information you want for your data analysis
## Idenify the video count, views, likes and comments of the channel
You can automate the process of collecting these information from a channel for the wholesome of the video it has.
After the data is written into a csv file I recommend you format it, using excel, if the dataset is relatively small
This makes further exploration ease

You can make any tweaks to the code to extract further information, you can use the Youtube API documentation for reference and guidance:
